Woof! Hello there, I'm Gallon, a charming Maltese from Korea. I may be small in size, but my playful spirit knows no bounds. As a proud boy, I bring joy and warmth to everyone I meet.

I absolutely adore staying at home, where I feel most comfortable and secure. Whether it's snuggling up on the couch or playing with my favorite toys, home is where my heart is. I have a knack for finding cozy spots and claiming them as my own.

I was born on April 9, 2020, so I'm still a young pup with plenty of energy and curiosity. Each day is an exciting adventure waiting to be explored, and I'm always eager to discover new things.

I have a soft and silky white coat that catches everyone's attention, and my dark, sparkling eyes are full of mischief. My human friends often comment on how adorable and fluffy I am, and I can't help but bask in the compliments.

While I enjoy spending quality time at home, I also love going for leisurely walks in the neighborhood. Exploring new scents and meeting fellow furry friends is always a delightful experience for me.

My mom is [Yifei Liu](https//www.).
