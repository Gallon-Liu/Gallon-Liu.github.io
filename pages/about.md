Woof! Greetings! I'm Gallon, a delightful Maltese. Although I may be petite in size, my lively spirit knows no bounds. As a proud little fellow, I bring boundless joy and warmth to everyone I encounter.

I was born on April 9, 2020, so I am still a youthful pup brimming with energy and an insatiable thirst for discovery. Each day is an exciting adventure waiting to be explored!

My exquisite white coat, velvety to the touch, never fails to captivate the attention of onlookers. My mischievous, obsidian eyes shimmer with intrigue, constantly inviting others to join in my escapades. My human companions often shower me with compliments, admiring my irresistible fluffiness, and I unabashedly bask in their adoration.

I absolutely relish the comforts of home, where I find solace and contentment. Whether it involves snuggling up on the couch or engaging in playful antics with my cherished toys, my heart finds its abode within the confines of my cozy haven. I have a knack for finding cozy spots and claiming them as my own.

While I enjoy spending quality time at home, I also love going for leisurely walks in the neighborhood. Exploring new scents and meeting fellow furry friends is always a delightful experience for me.
