Woof! Let's be friend! Here are some fun facts about me.

1. When I glance at someone with a tilt of my head, the white in my eyes becomes particularly noticeable.
   It's as if it gives me an extra touch of resemblance to humans.

2. I absolutely love to curl up on my side when it's time to catch some Z's. And guess what? I have this
   funny habit of using my paws to press against the wall. When I'm in a deep slumber, you might catch me
   occasionally snoring.

3. I'm not a picky eater at all, but there's something about berries and vegetables that make my tail wag
   with delight. Whether it's juicy strawberries, sweet blueberries, or crunchy carrots, I simply can't resist
   them.
